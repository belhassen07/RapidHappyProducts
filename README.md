# Rapid Happy Products

This a minimal collection of links oriented to people who want to design and build products in a rapid and pleasurable way.
This list is not intended to be a large list of links but rather an opinionated collection with tools I've used and enjoyed using. 

### Project management
- [Basecamp Personal](https://basecamp.com/personal)

### Documentation 
- [gitbook](http://gitbook.com/): used for creating books or documentations online. It produces elegant book design and has an enjoyable writing experience with large options to use as elements
- [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) or [Miro](https://miro.com/) (I used both and prefer Whimsical): You can create User flow diagrams, wireframes, mindmaps and sticky notes so it's perfect for ideation, information architechure a lot of other cool things you do when creating a product.

### Design
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html): This is my favorite UI design tool when creating high fidelity user interfaces. I tried the other ones but this suited me well, I encourage you to have fun with it and check the others.

### Development
- [React](https://reactjs.org) & [Material UI](https://material-ui.com): I love react and I also love the Material UI Kit, it speeds up the development process in a huge way.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): This is kind of the standard when testing APIs.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It's a very powerful code editor that I'm still trying to benefit more from it
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): I've experimented with this CSS utility library and it rocks ðŸ¤˜
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) / [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/): A great reliable framework with a pleasurable developer experience. Django REST Framework is a great tool when creating a SPA(for me when doing React)

### Productivity online
- [Motion](https://www.inmotion.app/): This Chrome extension keeps you from distracting websites. I tried a lot of these and what it stands out about this is that it actually works !

### Extra
- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/): This is a meditation app and it's amazing. I do have anxiety issues and this is helping me recover.
